# Expense

I developed this project to gain better control over my expenses. The main script's purpose is to add new expenses to a CSV file that represents all expenses for the month.

## How to Run
This project uses **UV**, a package and project manager, so you will need to install it. A complete installation guide is available in the [official documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

After installing UV, you can run the main script. To see the complete instructions on how the script works, run the following command:
```
uv run main.py -h
```
